## About the Video Course
What is UISplitViewController you might ask? Itâ€™s a common way of creating a master-detail application with a TableView and ViewControllers that load when a cell is selected.

This is the same feature the iPad embraces when viewing apps in Landscape - select a cell which will load different views accordingly. By the end of this course, you will know everything you need to know to start utilizing the features of UISplitViewController on supported devices.
